The purpose of this test is for us to get a sense of your skill level with the Elixir
Programming Language and to see how you think and your problem solving approach.

The problem we've chosen is a pricing system, since we use Elixir extensively in our
pricing system, we're also trying to mimic what it's like to calculate a price for
the delivery of a parcel, since we also do that quite extensively. So hopefully it gives
you a flavour for some of the problems you might work on at Sendle.


This exercise consists of one failing top level integration spec. If you run `mix test` you should
see it fail. Your goal is to get that test to pass.

* Write as many additional tests and modules as you feel you need.
* It's up to you to define the data structures used internally and returned by the functions.
* Feel free to use any hex packages you think will help and any Elixir, Erlang or OTP libraries
  you think are appropriate. Of course, the goal here is to show us clean, readable code and allow
  us to see that you have maintainability and correctness at the forefront of your thinking, so keep
  that in mind.
