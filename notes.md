# Marks Notes and initial observations

** This is intended to document my thoughts as I work through the coding problem.

Initial thoughts are :
 * SendleCodeTest module is not meaningful because it does not reflect any specific behaviour
 * module to hold prices will be useful
 * module to hold zones will be useful
 * require functionality to read in csv file into modules
 * module to hold shipments may possibly be useful
 * module to encapsulate the get quote behaviour will be useful - for this exercise perhaps the print_quotes functionality will be ok to live within this module.
 * Sorting on quote report may be nice - would require more testing but may meet the implied requirement that the report isn't neat
